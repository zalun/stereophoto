# StereoPhoto

## Goals:

### Basic:
 * Take pair of a photo and join to create a side-by-side stereophoto
 * Browse taken stereophotos using available technologies 
 * Sync stereophotos between devices using existing photo storage

### Advanced:
 * Automatically position stereo pair to achieve best results
 * Take a stereo pair photos using two devices (master-slave)

To avoid dealing with most of the security issues all user data is stored only
on the machine. Server is used only to serve an application. 

Current target devices:
 * smartphone
 * desktop
 * 3D TV
 * smartcamera (we will have to make one :)
